This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900, out.height=400}

library(dygraphs)

library(xts)
d=xts(data.frame(p1=rep(1:2, 5), p2=1:10), Sys.time()+(1:10)/5)
dygraph(d, "Test data", xlab = "Time", group = "group1") %>% dyRangeSelector()
dygraph(d, "Test data", xlab = "Time", group = "group1") %>% dyRangeSelector()

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
