\arguments{
\item{dygraph}{Dygraph to add callbacks to}

\item{clickCallback}{A function to call when the canvas is clicked.}

\item{drawCallback}{When set, this callback gets called every time the
dygraph is drawn. This includes the initial draw, after zooming and
repeatedly while panning.}

\item{highlightCallback}{When set, this callback gets called every time a new
point is highlighted.}

\item{pointClickCallback}{A function to call when a data point is clicked.
and the point that was clicked.}

\item{underlayCallback}{When set, this callback gets called before the chart
is drawn.}

\item{unhighlightCallback}{When set, this callback gets called every time the
user stops highlighting any point by mousing out of the graph.}

\item{zoomCallback}{A function to call when the zoom window is changed
(either by zooming in or out).}

\item{drawHighlightPointCallback}{Draw a custom item when a point is
highlighted. Default is a small dot matching the series color. This method
should constrain drawing to within pointSize pixels from (cx, cy)}

\item{drawPointCallback}{Draw a custom item when drawPoints is enabled.
Default is a small dot matching the series color. This method should
constrain drawing to within pointSize pixels from (cx, cy).}

\item{annotationClickHandler}{JavaScript function to call when an annotation
is clicked. This can also be specified on a per-annotation basis.}

\item{annotationMouseOverHandler}{JavaScript function to call when the mouse
hovers over an annotation. This can also be specified on a per-annotation
basis.}

\item{annotationMouseOutHandler}{JavaScript function to call when the mouse
exits an annotation. This can also be specified on a per-annotation basis.}

\item{annotationDblClickHandler}{JavaScript function to call when an
